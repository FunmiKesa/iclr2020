## Topics

Constraints introduced by low resource environments inspire new approaches to conventional ML problems. We encourage papers that address (but not limited to) the following topics. 

### Methods
Methods used to â€‹collect or generate training data with limited resources 
Machine learning techniques applied to limited data (e.g. few-shot and zero-shot)
Models that may be trained and run on low powered computational resources
Alternative learning methods coupled with deep models targeted for low resources


### Industry Experience and Applications

- Balancing accuracy/latency tradeoffs while scaling ML models in low resource environments.
- When machine learning is not a viable option.



## Instructions
