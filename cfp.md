## Topics

Constraints introduced by low resource environments inspire new approaches to conventional ML problems. We encourage papers that address (but are not limited to) the following topics. 

### Methods
- Methods used to â€‹collecting and generating training data within data scare settings.
- Machine learning techniques applied to limited data (e.g. active learning, few-shot and zero-shot learning).
- Approaches to training and inference on resource constrained devices (model quantization, model compression, model distillation, low precision training).
- Alternative learning methods coupled with deep models targeted for low resources


### Applications

- Balancing accuracy/latency tradeoffs while scaling ML models in low resource environments.
- Data-driven techniques that improve government transparency and/or encourage citizen participation in the government
- Measuring success or impact that goes beyond algorithmic metrics (such as accuracy or F1 score)


### Viewpoints and Industry Experience
- When machine learning is not a viable option.
- Successful AI solution implementation stories that work at a small scale (e.g., local institution, city) that could be applied at larger scale
- Connecting skilled professionals with the organizations that deeply understand the local problems
- Securing funding for proof-of-concept (POC) projects or for scaling existing POCs
- Building effective research and implementation teams, with a focus on challenges specific to developing regions such as countries in Africa.
